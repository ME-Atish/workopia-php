# Workopia, find your job in my dummy job listing app!

This project is a CRUD job listing application maintained with a Laravel-like architecture, all coded in vanilla PHP. This project is corresponded to [PHP From Scratch | Beginner to Advanced course](https://www.udemy.com/course/php-from-scratch-course/) by [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/traversymedia), one of the best programming instructors on the planet.

More info on the project and how to set that up? I highly recommend [check out the official repo](https://github.com/bradtraversy/workopia-php).
